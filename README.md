This is a Matrix Intro 
Morpheus presents Neo with a choice with the infamous Red Pill, Blue Pill. "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes".
